- 👋 Hi, I’m @stevenbrown163
- 👀 I’m interested in programming as a way to solve problems, which really doesn't narrow me down to any one field. This certainly includes anything requiring in-depth mathematics.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to use git/github tbh.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything useful.
- 📫 How to reach me
